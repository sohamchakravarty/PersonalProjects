    Hi {0}, <br/><br/>

    I am writing this mail to ask you a very simple question!! <br/>
    
    <blockquote>Do you keep your options open to diversify your bandwidth with entrepreneurship projects over and above what you currently do? </blockquote>

    I am writing this message in regard to an exciting opportunity for you. Apart from my regular job as an IT professional, I'm also working in
    entrepreneurship development and our team is currently looking to expand. Your profile looked impressive so thought of reaching out to you.<br/><br/>

    We are a team of professionals from top - tier colleges with entrepreneurial mindset. Along with our jobs we are working on an exciting and unique 
    business opportunity very passionately. <br/><br/>

    What we do? To put it in a gist, we work on a Tiered Distribution and Remuneration model, an innovative way via which we help our business partners
    generate revenues and we take a share of profit, often helping dedicated individuals of our team earn upwards of 8 lakh per annum in addition to their 
    full time job incomes. <br/><br/>

    This mail is just to see if we have a mutual opportunity here and if our frequencies match. We are looking for a few SHARP, AMBITIOUS & PRACTICAL 
    professionals to work with as we are expanding our business in {1} & other cities.(If your location is different from {1} do let me know).

    As of now we are going through lot of people and not sure if it fits you. I read it somewhere - <br/>
    <blockquote> <i>" If you are not working towards your "DREAMS".....you are definitely a part of someone else's dreams!!! ".</i></blockquote>

    Let me know if you are open to it. Also do share your contact details so that I could arrange for us to meet up(if that is feasible) or for you to
    attend a local orientation session since we are going through lot of people & is practically impossible to interact & share details with everyone 
    over phone / email. <br/><br/>
    
    P.S.- you could go through the attached document that could help you in understanding a little business fundamentals.

    You could also go through the video link
